## Project 1 - Changes in Technology Use

- Discord is a VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol) instant messaging and digital  distribution platform originally made to give gamers a place to build communities and talk about their niche hobbies. But since its launch in 2015, it has branched out to include  communities from all over the Internet. Ranging from gamers to writers to political activists, people can build communities, add voice channels (a channel where individuals can voice chat with other  members) , add text channels (a channel where individuals can text with other members), and many more, each with a different set of rules and different purposes. For instance, individuals might want a channel that is dedicated to talking about gaming, another one for audio calls, and another one for general chatting. Individuals can customize their channels as much as they want. They can add a category to the channel, change its topic descriptions, and /or adjust the member settings for each respective one. Discord can be customized to an entirely different level than other VoIP platforms and it is one of the possibilities to its huge  popularity overtime. To put it simply, Discord is created to allow users to message each  other. Each community we built is called “server”. People can find new servers by searching in Disboard (first, they have to type Disboard on their browser and go to Disboard). The servers should be tagged by their content; for example, a server for history should be tagged to the history category so people must by the tag. Disboard is the place where users can go to find or list Discord servers, and it can also be quite useful to add their server. While chatting, users can use slash commands like “/nick” or “/giphy”, etc… to express themselves or to do  certain things. 

> **"/nick" [new Nickname]: This command changes their name that appears on the server.**

- They  must enter the nickname they want to replace their current name and then press enter. 

> **"/giphy [Search Term]: Users can use this command to find animated GIFs.**

- After they search  this, the search results will appear above their chat box. If they don’t find the right GIF, they can use the “/tenor” command to search a different service for different results. Users can also add bots to their servers. After they add bots, the bots can join the channels and sit in the user list until commanded with slash commands. 

- The year 2020 was a year of chaos and disappointment mainly because of the global pandemic, which shut down our day-to-day activities and the reason for the loss of  many lives. There were huge limitations for the physical relationship with the outside. Most of the activities we used to do physically suddenly stopped such as jobs, schools, and extracurricular pursuits. So in order to turn this bad situation around and keep the country’s socioeconomic status from collapsing, many have turned to a different approach: they shifted to online platforms so people could work or study from home.  As more people have worked, studied and socialized online, the popularity of Discord has skyrocketed. Since students cannot study physically in groups like they used to before the pandemic, students can now create servers for educational purposes and add voice and text channels for each subject. Not only that, students can also join other  communities by searching on Disboard. There were some really amazing servers created during this pandemic time with members from throughout the world. Lots of interesting educational knowledge was shared within these channels. Before the pandemic, the Discord hype train was good but not this big. But as people started to socialize via Discord, it gained this huge boost of popularity and because of the ability to create communities and to join servers by searching lists. If it wasn’t for this pandemic situation,  Discord’s plethora of servers wouldn’t be this vast. Right now, there are servers for almost every subject, and joining them can truly improve someone’s knowledge.

- When the year 2020 started locking people in their houses, people’s work and studying rhythm styles changed.  Instead of going outside to pursue their normal routines, people got used to staying home and doing these things. Skype and Zoom meetings replaced meeting rooms and schools. It basically turned people’s careers and academic lives upside down. We used to study as a group and discuss with friends in the library or someplace in the school/university. But due to the pandemic, we couldn’t hang out with our friends/colleagues and study as a team, denying us the opportunity to reap the benefits of in-person interactions and camaraderie. Even  though there are other social media platforms, Discord's amazing ability to customize made it  the fan favorite. Discord basically replaced physical team academics by letting users create servers and joining them. So now, students don’t need to get together physically in order to discuss academic related matters. 

- Here is the definition of the ritual view of communication: communication is directed not toward the extension of messages in space, but toward the maintenance of society in time. It  is the less popular definition of communication. It is explained as a representation of shared beliefs and draws people together in friendly association. 
“Sharing”, “participation”, “association”, “possession of a common faith” and “fellowship” are some terms of the ritual view of communication for which Discord is a place where we can build a community and exchange ideas not only with people we’ve known, but also with the ones we meet for the first time in the community allowing us to become a part of a something far bigger than our self. For instance, say you join a Discord community about history, a very active community filled with thirsty people from all around the world, sharing their ideas, their theories, and the histories of their countries. Suddenly, you become a member of a society who not only just texts about history, but also  shares your ideas, participates in an intriguing conversation. That way, you become a part of something like your usual gang whom you’ve discussed your academics with in the past. You engage in something very interesting. These communities are unique and they have their own shape just like any community it evolves with time reshaping and growing as a whole. It helps us to keep in touch with others while sharing our true ambitions, which fits perfectly in line with the ritual view of communication. To paraphrase Carey, “A ritual view of communication is directed not toward the extension of message in  space, but towards the maintenance of society in time: not the act of imparting information  but the representation of shared beliefs” **(Carey, 1989, page 5)**. And also to paraphrase Williams, “The making of a society is the finding of common meaning and directions, and its  growth is an active debate and amendment, under the pressure of experience, contact, and  discovery, writing themselves into the land” **(Raymond Williams, 1958)**.

- Becoming a part of something unique is very special. In my perspective, communicating with someone is special. When there is less or no communication among people, the societies will perish. Think about the time we spent with our friends, the mall talks, the jokes, the  discussions and also the arguments, this all makes the bond even more amazing. Due to the pandemic, we cannot do this physically like in the past, but Discord can keep these bonds alive and also create new bonds. To  paraphrase Carey again, “If the archetypical case of communication under a transmission view is the extension  of messages across geography for the purpose if control, the archetypical case of  communication under a ritual view is the sacred ceremony that draws person together in  fellowship and commonality” **(Carey, 1989, page 5)**.

- Considering all of these things, you can safely and surely say Discord has become a  communication ritual. Like I said, Discord is an amazing place to join communities and make new friends throughout the globe and exchange ideas, we share ideas, we discuss ideas (both in text and  in voice calls) and we even engage in small talk. But like everything this also has pros and cons. The pros are spread throughout above and the con is actually just one thing. Sometimes, the technology that we use to increase our knowledge can be the same thing that makes us less intellectually stimulated. We usually use the Internet to search things or add things to the Internet. And when we use it for almost everything, it’s like we didn’t even try. Browsing the Internet and reading a book for our knowledge are two different things in a entirely different level; there is only “reading makes a man perfect” there isn’t a “searching  stuff in the Internet to get the facts you want makes a man perfect,” and I’m sure that there  never will be any such quote. When you read a book to gain knowledge, it gives you more than what you want, but when you search stuff, you don't put any effort. You just type, search, then in an instant, it displays what you ask, and all you have to do is type or copy it down. It’s just as easy and mind numbing, but sure, we can search a lot of things easily and  freely. After all, it gives us a wider range of fields to search and makes us smarter on one side. But on the other hand, it doesn't give us a chance to actually think hard enough like when we read a book . To paraphrase Nicholas Carr, “As the media theorist Marshall McLuhan pointed out in the 1960s, media are not just  passive channels of information. They supply the stuff of thought, but they also  shape the process of thought. And what the Internet seems to be doing is chipping away my  capacity for concentration and contemplation. My mind now expects to take information the  way the Internet distributes it: in a swiftly moving stream of particles. Once I was a scuba diver  in the sea of words. Now I zip along the surface like a guy on Jet Ski” **(Nicholas Carr, 2008)**. We are so used to technology now that we can’t live a single day without our smartphone. We need it for most of our daily activities. We can do so much more with technology, but we don’t exactly have the full completion of doing something properly. “Historically, technology has made us smarter. Technology has made us able to do  more while understanding less about what we are doing, and has increased our dependence  on others” **(Jonathan Coopersmith, 2016)**. We used to think technology delivers what we asked but however, that has not always been the case. Sometimes when we search something, we get completely irrelevant search results. And every time we search something and deliver it to somewhere (example: to a community in Discord) not only we  outsource our thinking capacity, but also we’re projecting the knowledge we gain by outsourcing our thinking towards others. “Once I’m done meandering, however I answer yes. I believe we may be making  ourselves dumber when we outsource thinking and rely on supposedly smart tech or micromanage our daily lives for the sake of cheap convenience” **(Brett Frischmann, 2018)**. Like I said, even though too much technology takes our thinking away, we can get a lot  of use from technology if we use it correctly. Too much of anything is good for nothing. We should know our limits of using the Internet technologies. If we find the balance between thinking and browsing the Internet for useful stuff only when it’s necessary then we  can take the full advantage of the Internet and we can add more useful stuff to the Internet  and have faith that ideas that are worth browsing are on the Internet.  “The issue isn’t whether there’s a lots of dumb stuff online-there is, just as there is  lots of dumb stuff in bookstores. The issue is whether there are any ideas so good today that  they will survive into the future” **(Shirky, 2010, page 4)**.

- In my opinion, technology makes people smarter if they use it correctly. But if they use it just to cultivate their opinions or to find answers to every question that comes to their mind, it will deprive them of intellectual thought and critical thinking skills.

## Project 2 - Object of Creation

</p>

- **Object of Technology:** My object of technology was social media applications in general, notably Discord, which challenges many people's preconceived notions about online digital networking. As a student in Professor Jeong's COMM 12 course, my project aims to communicate concepts on context collapse and conversation patterns as communication techniques offered over a period of weeks.

- **Desired Content:** I sought to collect a list of well-known tropes and clichés that CS field majors have encountered and/or exhibited on Discord, for which I consider myself to be a large majority of users in the “CS major on Discord” subculture.

- **Object of Creation:** My object of creation is an infographic depicting the "Average CS Discord Starter Pack," at least from my perspective and experience with the app over three years. It's around three pages long, while I initially intended for it to be a single page long.

- **Explanation/Description:**
  - I wanted to build something solid and comprehensive for my project, which might theoretically also be a meme of some form, and the starting pack infographic seemed to seal the deal in that respect. As a meme aficionado, someone who collects, saves, and generates a wide range of memes, I thought this would be an excellent fit given the demands of the project. I created my infographic using Pixlr, a free picture and online graphic design tool, and locally uploaded all of the photos and added text into the canvas, which I scaled to 1920 by 1080 pixels.

  - To obtain the photos, I went to my Discord servers and utilized my computer's Snip & Sketch tool to capture screenshots of text discussions, custom user statuses, and profile photos that I believed best portrayed the online "CS major Discord user" subculture. In addition, I added photographs of an office setting as well as sites such as Youtube, Github, Stackoverflow, and Reddit to thoroughly convey the CS major experience. In the case of text conversation, I had to blot out the users' usernames/nicknames for the sake of secrecy and to avoid any potential bias.

  - After designing three panels for the starter kit meme, I used the website AConvert to splice the photos together so they looked like one entire infographic, similar to the ones in Canva. This will make my "Average CS Discord Starter Pack" a lot more coherent than labeling each one as Part 1...Part 2...Part 3... while remaining as separate images.

  - I based my design on the starter pack meme templates, which are a collection of multi-panel photo and text sets intended to demonstrate the archetype but not confined to any particular people, social group, consumer product, or multi-media. Furthermore, the phrase "starting kit" has long been used in commercial and educational publications to designate introductory instructions. It is described as "a package of articles or equipment offering the needed things and instructions for embarking on a specific activity or procedure for the first time" and can be found from time to time on the Internet.

- **How It Connects to the Readings:**

  - My initial step in this creative process was to go through the readings and choose phrases from them to base my object of creation on, hence I focused on phrases from Burgess's reading:

    > *"If you do stick around, don’t expect to ever find that “authentic” online version of yourself."*

    > *"There really isn’t such a thing,” Marwick said. “It’s really always a performance."*

  - These sentences really stood out to me, therefore I emphasized their relevance in my design by describing how Computer Science majors on Discord frequently feel with their online presence. It is possible that people would project a distorted sense of self or will act as though someone or something is out to get them for no apparent cause. What I mean is that imposter syndrome and superiority/inferiority complexes are quite common given the daunting playing field of the CS field, which subconsciously hurt or help people in many ways especially on Discord. 

  - In addition, Baumer et al.’s reading encapsulates the overall use cases of most apps, especially Discord, within a community with a predominant amount of users in the CS field:

    > *"Social media often plays an important role in much of modern life, from building social capital,
      self-presentation, and impression management to maintain connections with friends."*

    > *"Psychological experiments suggest that the format of online information may restructure our brain, 
      making us less able to attend to focused tasks for extended periods of time."*

  - As a result, it does many things, such as developing connections, trust, and self-image, in order to construct a complete picture of a specific group of individuals inside a contextualized setting devoid of distractions such as algorithms and digital clutter seen in many apps. However, Discord is not immune to context collapse and poor communication tactics. As a result, depending on the situation, online users would behave differently and fairly impulsively, and this is commonly seen on social media, producing this contextual collapse. Given the circumstances, these two sentences from the Marwick and Boyd interpretations piqued my interest:
  
    > *"Another approach some respondents took was to conceptualize their audience as an 'ideal' person."*

    > *"In the absence of certain knowledge about the audience, participants take cues from the social media environment to imagine the community."*

  - In my initial thought process, I used these quotations to narrow down what I was going to focus on inside context collapse. Many things are situational, therefore with social media, especially inside Discord, you don't have a single context and your audience might be anyone in any given server with any given purpose and intention. In this situation, as demonstrated by my object of creation, CS majors "bind" ourselves to our receiving communities and identify our target audience based on our certain social characteristics, traits, and inside jokes. This corresponds to what the audience conceives as the "ideal human” for which the imagined audience might be entirely different from the actual human beings they view themselves in real life.
